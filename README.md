# Project Title: Bored API - Random Activity Generator

Welcome to the Bored API - a simple web application designed for the purpose of an interview process. This project is built using Flask for the backend and React JS for the frontend, with the goal of generating a list of random activities based on user requests. The activities can be monitored, removed, or checked later.

## Getting Started

The Bored API project consists of two main folders: backend and frontend.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using pip.
4. Run the Flask application.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder.
2. Install Node.js and npm.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using npm.
4. Run the React application.

For detailed instructions, refer to the README.md files in the backend and frontend folders.

## Project Details

This application has several features, including:

- Generating a list of random activities based on user requests.
- Monitoring, removing, or checking activities.
- A user-friendly interface built with React JS.

## Challenges

During the development of this project, we faced several challenges, such as:

- Ensuring the randomness of the generated activities.
- Implementing a system to manage the activities.
- Creating an intuitive user interface with React JS.

## Possible Improvements

For future improvements, we recommend:

- Implementing unit testing and writing tests to ensure the application's functionality and stability.
- Improving scalability by optimizing the code and implementing caching mechanisms.
- Handling wrongful user inputs by implementing input validation and error handling.
- Enhancing the user interface with better design and visual appeal (even though I am not a design artist, I can still try my best!).
- Implementing a more sophisticated algorithm for generating activities.
- Adding user authentication and authorization.
- Improving the user interface for better user experience.
- Setting a limit on the number of requests a user can make to prevent abuse and improve system performance.

By implementing these improvements, the Bored API can become a more robust and user-friendly application.

## Conclusion

The Bored API is a simple web application that demonstrates the ability to generate random activities and manage them. It provides a foundation for more complex applications, showcasing the power of Flask and React JS. We hope this project inspires you to build even more impressive web applications.
